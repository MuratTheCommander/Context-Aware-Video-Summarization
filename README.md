# Context-Aware Video Summarization (CAVS)

This repository contains an **educational implementation** of a context-aware video summarization framework.  
It explores how low-level visual features and high-level semantic graphs can be combined to generate concise video summaries.  

⚠️ **Disclaimer**:  
This project is for **educational and research purposes only**.  
It is **not ready for production use** and is under active development.

## Overview

CAVS works in three main stages:

1. **Spatio-Temporal Interest Point Detection (STIP)**  
   - Detects regions of motion and appearance changes in video.  

2. **Feature Representation (HOG + HOF)**  
   - Extracts visual (HOG) and motion (HOF) descriptors around detected points.  

3. **Graph-Based Summarization**  
   - Builds graphs over detected features.  
   - Learns dictionaries for features (`Df`) and graphs (`Dg`).  
   - Uses sparse coding with group sparsity constraints.  
   - Generates summaries by identifying novel or important segments.

## Current Status

- ✅ Custom STIP detection implemented  
- ✅ HOG + HOF feature extraction working  
- ✅ Graph construction with semantic matching  
- ✅ Dictionary learning and online updates  
- ⚠️ Sparse optimization still being refined  
- ⚠️ Not optimized for large datasets

## Educational Purpose

- This project was developed as part of a learning and research exercise.  
- Code is experimental and will continue to improve over time.  
- It is **not intended for production deployment**.  

---

## Roadmap

- Improve stability of sparse coding solver  
- Optimize dictionary update routines  
- Test on larger and more diverse datasets  
- Add evaluation metrics and visualizations
