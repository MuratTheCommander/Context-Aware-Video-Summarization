# CAVS: Context-Aware Video Summarization (Educational Prototype)

This repository contains an **experimental implementation** of the **CAVS (Context-Aware Video Summarization)** method.  
The system combines motion-based feature extraction, dictionary learning, and semantic graph matching to generate compact video summaries.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**:  
- This project is for **research and educational purposes only**.  
- It is **not production-ready** and will be continuously improved over time.  
- Current implementation may contain incomplete or experimental components.

## Pipeline Overview

The system processes videos in several stages:

1. **STIP Detection** ‚Äì Spatio-temporal interest points are detected in video frames.  
2. **Feature Extraction** ‚Äì HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) and HOF (Histogram of Optical Flow) features are computed at each interest point.  
3. **Dictionary Learning** ‚Äì Sparse Group Lasso (SGL) is used to learn a feature dictionary (`Df`) and sparse coefficients (`B`).  
4. **Graph Construction** ‚Äì Segments are represented as graphs with STIPs as nodes and spatial/temporal edges.  
5. **Semantic Matching** ‚Äì Graph similarity is computed, and novel or informative segments are selected using semantic matching.  
6. **Summary Generation** ‚Äì Selected segments are merged into a video summary.
